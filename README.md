# time-of-day

## Background:
In this assignment, you'll work with the JavaScript [Date object](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp) to integrate information from the client's system clock into a web page.  Consider adding data to the page using document.getElementById() for example to place your data on the page.

## Deliverable:
Create a web page that uses JavaScript to determine the current hour, and presents a different image, custom message, and color based on each of the following times of day:

* Morning (5am to 12 noon)
* Afternoon (12 noon to 6pm)
* Evening (6pm to 11pm)
* Night (11pm to 5am)

Criteria: The three items above (color, image, message) must be unique for each of the 4 time periods of the day.

## Example:
For example, between 5am and 12 noon, your page could show a picture of the sun, a saying that says 'Good Morning!' and the color orange for the background of the page, or perhaps a different style.

## Dynamic Copyright:
Your page must also produce a dynamic copyright, produced by JavaScript.  This means the year must change dynamically, for example, Â© 2015-2021, in which 2021 is written dynamically via the Date() object, and changes to the current year as the years go by.
